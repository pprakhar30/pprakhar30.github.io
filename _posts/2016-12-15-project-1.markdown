### EEG Signals

Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain. It is typically noninvasive, with the electrodes placed along the scalp, although invasive electrodes are sometimes used in specific applications. There are four types of brain waves of interests based upon their frequency:

1. Delta (<4 *Hz*)
2. Theta (4-7 *Hz*)
3. Alpha (8-15 *Hz*)
4. Beta  (16-31 *Hz*)

### Word Familiarity

This is the task where we try to find out whether or not a subject is familiar with the given word or not using just the EEG signals.
We collected samples from 13 subjects in which they were shown a list of 25 words and they were supposed to tell whether or not they knew the meaning.The recording of one of the subject was of no use because of too much noise and hence was discarded.
For each subject we get approximately 105 seconds of brain activation map video corresponding to each of the alpha and theta bands. 
All the 105 seconds videos are converted to 64 X 64 pixel frames and these frames are then divided into 25 different subset of frames. These subsets represent a single instance of data and these are further divided into 7 parts. All the frames in these parts are aggregated into a single image. So, a group of 7 such images corresponds to single instance of data.
